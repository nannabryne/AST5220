We implemented a class in \verb|C++| that assumes a background, an object of the class from \cref{mil1:sec:imp}, and a primordial helium abundance $Y_P$. The code we wrote (1) calculated $X_e(x)$ (and $n_e(x)$) from the Saha and Peebles equations and (2) computed $\tau(x)$ as well as $\gti(x)$, $\dv*[]{\gti(x)}{x}$ and $\dv*[2]{\gti(x)}{x}$ for a given array of $x$-values. %We chose the interval $x\in [-14, 2]$.

We ran an additional simulation where we assumed equilibrium all the way, that is we solved for $X_e(x)$ using only the Saha equation. 

\subsubsection{Electron fraction and number density}\label[sec]{mil2:imp:sec:Xe_ne}
    The computation of $X_e(x)$ was divided into two parts. We let $X_e(x)>0.99$ signify the Saha regime for which we use the Saha approximation in \cref{mil2:theo:eq:Saha}. Numerically speaking, the solution to this equation, 
    \begin{equation}\label{mil2:imp:eq:sol_Saha}
        X_e(x) = \frac{\expr}{2}\left( -1+\sqrt{1+4\expr^{-1}}\right)\,; \quad 
            \expr = \frac{1}{n\ped{b}} \left( \frac{m_e k\ped{B} T\ped{b} }{2\pi \hbar^2} \right)^{\sfrac{3}{2}} \eu^{\epskT},
    \end{equation}
    blows up for large values of $\expr$. Analytically we have $X_e\to 1$ as $\expr\to \infty$, so we circumvented the issue by letting $X_e(x)=1 \,\forall \expr > 10^7$. Outside of the Saha regime, we used the last value of $X_e(x)$ ($\approx 0.99$) as initial condition on the Peebles ODE (\cref{mil2:theo:eq:Peebles}) and solved this for the remaining values of $x$. Here as well, we needed to adress numerical stability concerns. Specifically, $\beta^{(2)}$ in \cref{mil2:theo:eq:Peebles_beta2} was set to zero when the exponent was too large; $\epskT> 200$, i.e. at later times when $T\ped{b} < 0.005 \epsilon_0/k\ped{B} \sim 800$~K.

\subsubsection{Optical depth and visibility}\label[sec]{mil2:imp:sec:tau_gt}
    We computed $\tau(x)$ by solving the simple ODE in \cref{mil2:theo:eq:ode_tau_of_x} starting from $x=0$ where $\tau(0)=0$ and integrating backwards. We used the analytical expressions in \cref{mil2:theo:eq:ode_tau_of_x} and \cref{mil2:theo:eq:gt_of_x} for $\dv*{\tau(x)}{x}$ and $\gti(x)$, respectively, and found $\dv*[2]{\tau(x)}{x}$, $\dv*{\gti(x)}{x}$ and $\dv*[2]{\gti(x)}{x}$ numerically.
