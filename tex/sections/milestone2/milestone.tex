After the Big Bang, the universe was in a state of high temperature and density, making it impossible for atoms to form. Instead, all matter existed as a highly ionised plasma. It was only when the universe began to expand and cool down that the conditions allowed for the combination of ions and electrons. This process resulted in the formation of atoms, primarily hydrogen and helium, during the ``epoch of recombination'' around 380\,000 years after the Big Bang, when the temperature had dropped to around 3000~K. Prior to this, photons could not travel freely through the ionised plasma as they were scattered by free electrons. However, as free electrons combined with other baryons to form neutral atoms during recombination, the mean free path of the photons increased. The photons emitted during this period make up the CMB radiation.

We will in this section examine the free electron fraction and followingly the optical depth and visibility function. \colorbox{green}{more here!}
