% FUTURE TENSE


In the previous sections, we have considered the homogeneous and isotropic universe. We now turn our attention to the \textit{in}homogeneities in the matter and \textit{an}isotropies in the cosmic distribution of photons---those which have given rise to the evolution of structure in the universe. 

We will study perturbation quantities for small-scale physics, as well as for larger scales. From the photon temperature perturbations, we get the temperature source function which will be important when eventually computing the CMB spectrum. The following analysis is completely ignorant of neutrinos in the universe and photon polarisation.

In this section, we focus more on the mathematics and technicalities of the perturbations than on the physics driving them. The latter will be covered in more detail in~\cref{sec:mil4}.
