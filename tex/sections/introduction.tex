% WORKIG INTRO

The overall purpose of this project is to produce a program that calculates the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) power spectrum and predict the CMB and matter fluctuations through it. We want to achieve this starting from first principles. A large part of this paper follows~\citet{Callin2006}.

We consider the concordance model of cosmology model that a Euclidean universe currently dominated by non-baryonic cold dark matter (CDM) and a cosmological constant (\textLambda), namely the (flat) \textLambda CDM model. The cosmological constant \textLambda\, is used as a moniker for dark energy (DE).~\citep{DodelsonBook}
