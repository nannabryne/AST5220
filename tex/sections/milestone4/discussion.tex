The Sachs-Wolfe and Doppler contributions to the CMB anisotropy are by far most significant in order to reproduce the observed spectrum. We spot the Sachs-Wolfe plateau for small $\ell$. The quadrupole term is negligible in our model. We spot the increasing significance of the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect for smaller $\ell$.
