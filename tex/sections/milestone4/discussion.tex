The transfer functions in~\cref{mil4:res:fig:transfer} 



We turn to the main result of this project in~\cref{mil4:res:fig:CMB_power}. The Sachs-Wolfe and Doppler contributions to the CMB anisotropy are by far most significant in order to reproduce the observed spectrum. We spot the Sachs-Wolfe plateau for small $\ell$. The polarisation term is negligible in our model. 

The increasing significance of the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect for smaller $\ell$ is visible in the plot. This is the late-time ISW large-scale effect kicking in as dark energy starts to dominate and thereby affect the gravitational potential in such a way that \textcolor{blue}{help}
