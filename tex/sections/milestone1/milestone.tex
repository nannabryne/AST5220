The geometry of the background is determined by the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) metric (\cref{sec1:theory:eq:FRW}).

% comment about flatness

As a starting point, we use a flat universe. However, we keep the variables associated with the curvature in our deduced expressions, as they become relevant later. 

After creating our cosmological model, we use observational data \citep{2014A&A...568A..22B} to find suitable cosmological parameters. In particular, we translate our model to spit out pairs of redshift and luminosity distance for a set of density parameters (today's values), and compare the computed data points with the observed ones. The best-fit model is found by performing a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) that goes through the Metropolis algorithmÂ \textcolor{red}{REFERENCE! Remember explainantion in Implementation}.
